# Mathematical Projects (previously a repo dedicated to approximate Pi, but I want to be more inclusive!)

## Simulations to Approximate Pi

## 1. [Monte Carlo Method](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/Pi%20Approximation)
Definition: a technique in which a large quantity of randomly generated numbers are studied using a probabilistic model to find an approximate solution to a numerical problem that would be difficult to solve by other methods

## What I learned
* Math and Random library
* JavaScript's Canvas
* Window methods: confirm(), alert()
* HTML: Button usage
* CSS: font-family, margin, border, etc.

## 2. Sorting Algorithms
* [Bubble](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/SortingAlgorithms/BubbleSort)
* [Selection](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/SortingAlgorithms/Selection%20Sort)
* [Insertion](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/SortingAlgorithms/Insertion%20Sort)
* [Merge](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/SortingAlgorithms/Merge%20Sort)

## 3. Searching Algorithms
* [Linear](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/Searching%20Algorithm/Linear%20Search)
* [Binary](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/Searching%20Algorithm/Binary%20Search)

## 4. Cryptography
* [Morse Code](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/Cryptography/MorseCode)
* [Reverse Cipher](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/Cryptography/CaesarCipher)
* [Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/Cryptography/CaesarCipher)
* Transposition Cipher:
  * [Columnar](https://github.com/AoWangDrexel/MathematicalProjects/tree/master/Cryptography/TranspositionCipher)
