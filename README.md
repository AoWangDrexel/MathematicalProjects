# Mathematical Projects (previously a repo dedicated to approximate Pi, but I want to be more inclusive!)

## Simulations to Approximate Pi

## 1. Monte Carlo Method
Definition: a technique in which a large quantity of randomly generated numbers are studied using a probabilistic model to find an approximate solution to a numerical problem that would be difficult to solve by other methods

## What I learned
* Math and Random library
* JavaScript's Canvas
* Window methods: confirm(), alert()
* HTML: Button usage
* CSS: font-family, margin, border, etc.

## 2. Sorting Algorithms
* Bubble 
* Selection

## 3. Searching Algorithms
* Linear
* Binary

## 4. Cryptography
* Morse Code
* Reverse Cipher
* Caesar Cipher
* Transposition Cipher:
  * Columnar
